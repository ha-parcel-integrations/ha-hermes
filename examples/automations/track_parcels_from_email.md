# Automatic parcel tracking from e-mail (IMAP → Hermes)

Companion guide for [`track_parcels_from_email.yaml`](track_parcels_from_email.yaml): watch your mailbox(es) for shipping e-mails, extract the Hermes tracking code, and register it with `hermes.track_parcel` — fully automatic, no extra custom component required.

Hermes is a **code-based** carrier: it has no account inbox, so every parcel must be registered by its tracking code before the integration can follow it. This recipe automates exactly that step.

**How it works, in one line:** the core [IMAP integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/imap/) fires an `imap_content` event for every new e-mail (including the body); the automation extracts the tracking code — a cheap regex first, an optional AI fallback for everything else — and calls `hermes.track_parcel`.

```
new e-mail ──imap_content──▶ automation ──▶ regex match? ──▶ hermes.track_parcel
                                     │
                                     └──▶ no match, but looks like a shipping mail
                                          ──▶ ai_task.generate_data (optional)
                                              ──▶ tracking code
```

## Prerequisites

- This integration, with the `hermes.track_parcel` action available (field `tracking_code`).
- The core **IMAP** integration (ships with Home Assistant, no HACS needed).
- *(Optional but recommended)* an **AI Task** entity (e.g. Anthropic/Claude, Google, OpenAI) for the fallback path. Without it, simply delete the `else:` block — the regex path works standalone.

## Step 1 — IMAP entries

Add **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → IMAP** for every account you want to watch:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server | `imap.gmail.com` (Gmail) — mind the hostname, it is **not** `imap.google.com` |
| Port | `993` |
| Username | your address |
| Password | see the Gmail note below |
| Charset | `utf-8` |
| Folder | `INBOX` (or a label/subfolder — see below) |

Then open the entry's **Configure** (options) and set:

- **Message data to include in the event**: enable **text** (the automation needs the body!)
- **Max message size**: raise it to `30000` — carrier mails are long and the default cuts them off before the tracking code appears.
- Leave *search* on `UnSeen UnDeleted` and *push* enabled (IMAP IDLE → events arrive within seconds).

**Multiple mailboxes / accounts:** each IMAP entry is one account × folder combination. Add the same account again with a different folder to watch labels (Gmail labels appear as IMAP folders). All entries fire the *same* `imap_content` event, so **one automation covers all of them**.

**Gmail note:** since May 2025 Google blocks plain-password IMAP logins ("less secure apps"). Use an **app password** instead (requires 2-step verification): <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>.

## Step 2 — the automation

Paste [`track_parcels_from_email.yaml`](track_parcels_from_email.yaml) and adapt the notify action, the keyword list and the AI entity to your setup.

### Tracking-code formats

Hermes Paket tracking numbers are **14 digits**, so the regex matches a bare
14-digit run:

```
(?<![0-9])[0-9]{14}(?![0-9])
```

A plain 14-digit match is inherently noisy — order numbers and other references
in the same mail look identical — so unlike carriers with a distinctive prefix,
Hermes leans harder on the **keyword gate** (`is_parcel_mail`) and the **AI
fallback** to decide what is really a parcel. Treat the regex as a first-pass
candidate finder, not a precise matcher.

### Design notes

- **Regex first, AI second.** Mails straight from the carrier match the regex and never touch the AI. The AI fallback earns its keep on the messy cases: forwarded mails, webshop confirmations, unfamiliar layouts.
- **Duplicates are harmless:** calling `track_parcel` twice for the same code is a no-op, and the `initial` condition already suppresses re-triggers of the same message.
- **`mode: queued`** so a burst of mails (mailbox sync) is processed one by one instead of being dropped.

## Pitfalls we hit so you don't have to

1. **Jinja eats backslashes in string literals.** A template stored as `regex_findall('\bEXAMPLE…')` silently becomes a **backspace character** (`\b` is a string escape), so the regex never matches — no error anywhere. That's why the pattern is backslash-free: `(?<![0-9A-Za-z])` lookarounds instead of `\b`, `[0-9]` instead of `\d`. Copy that style if you add a prefix.
2. **The `initial` event flag means the opposite of what you might expect.** In the IMAP integration `initial: true` = *first time this message is seen* (new mail); `false` = a duplicate trigger of the same message. So the condition must **require** `initial`, not exclude it.
3. **Raise the max message size.** With the default the body is truncated before the tracking code appears in most carrier mails. `30000` is plenty.
4. **Enable "text" in the event options.** Without it the event has headers only and there is nothing to extract.
5. **Gmail = app password.** Plain passwords stopped working on Google IMAP in May 2025; app passwords (with 2FA) are the supported route. And the host is `imap.gmail.com`.

## Testing without waiting for a real parcel

Fire a fake event and watch the automation trace (Settings → Automations → your automation → Traces):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $HA_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://YOUR_HA:8123/api/events/imap_content \
  -d '{"sender":"noreply@hermesshipping.com","subject":"Your parcel is on its way",
       "text":"Tracking code: EXAMPLE123456","initial":true,"folder":"INBOX","username":"test"}'
```

Then `hermes.untrack_parcel` the test code afterwards. For a full end-to-end test, forward a real shipping mail to the watched mailbox — it must arrive **unread**.
